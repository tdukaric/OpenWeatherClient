# OpenWeatherClient

Universal Windows Application which gather data from OpenWeather and display it on the screen.
Supports all Windows 10 platforms (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Communication between application and OpenWeather service has been implemented via interface and abstract class to create a platform
where it's easy to add additional data provider like Yahoo or AccuWeather.

Supports geolocation and search by city name.

Still work-in-progress.
